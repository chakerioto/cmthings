Parallax
Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links below to see the difference between a website with and without parallax scrolling.

Note: Parallax scrolling does not always work on mobile devices/smart phones. However, you can use media queries to turn off the effect on mobile devices (see last example on this page).

// Core things is Background css Fixed
// Div parralax scrolling up but the background image stay still

// One parralax div in the top and one parralax div in the final to make scrolling
